## [Exercise 00] : Megaphone

- **Description:**
The Megaphone program is designed to echo input arguments in uppercase. When executed, it takes input strings as arguments and converts them to uppercase letters, then prints the result. If no arguments are provided, it outputs a specific message. The program ensures that all input strings are converted to uppercase, making the output loud and clear.

  To run, open the terminal and type 'make', and the program will compile.

```shell
valgrind ./<programe_name>
```


For assurance, run with Valgrind by executing 'valgrind ./<programe_name>' to check for errors and memory leaks."

### [Exercise 01] : My Awesome PhoneBook

- **Description:**

My Awesome PhoneBook is a basic phonebook software written in C++. It consists of two classes: PhoneBook and Contact. The PhoneBook class manages an array of contacts and can store up to 8 contacts. If the user tries to add a 9th contact, the oldest one is replaced. The Contact class represents a phonebook contact. The program allows users to add new contacts, search for existing contacts, and exit the phonebook.

### [Exercise 02] : The Job Of Your Dreams

- **Description:**

The Job Of Your Dreams task involves recreating a lost file, Account.cpp, based on available files such as Account.hpp and a log file. The log file provides clues about the implementation of the Account class. The goal is to recreate the Account.cpp file by analyzing the provided files and ensuring that the recreated program passes the tests. This exercise tests the understanding and implementation skills of C++ classes and member functions.
